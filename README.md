### Project Description
Clickscape is a playful, beautifully useless website that reacts to user clicks with quirky messages, sounds, and smooth scrolling.
It has no goal ‚Äî just a strangely satisfying experience designed for fun, curiosity, and creative expression.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have too many meaningful interactions online. We wanted to fix that.
So we created a space where you can click endlessly, achieve absolutely nothing, and still feel oddly fulfilled.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a gloriously useless website where every click rewards you with nonsense ‚Äî quirky messages, soothing sounds, and smooth scrolling.
It‚Äôs interactive, it‚Äôs satisfying, it does absolutely nothing ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the point.
