### Project Description
Clickscape is a playful, beautifully useless website that reacts to user clicks with quirky messages, sounds, and smooth scrolling.
It has no goal ‚Äî just a strangely satisfying experience designed for fun, curiosity, and creative expression.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have too many meaningful interactions online. We wanted to fix that.
So we created a space where you can click endlessly, achieve absolutely nothing, and still feel oddly fulfilled.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a gloriously useless website where every click rewards you with nonsense ‚Äî quirky messages, sounds, and smooth scrolling.
It‚Äôs interactive, it‚Äôs satisfying, it does absolutely nothing ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the point.

### Project Demo
# Video
"C:\Users\gital\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\Screen Recording 2025-08-02 163041.mp4"
This video demonstrates how clickspace works. The first window has different mood boards and when a particular mood board is chosen, it has three categories. Those categories can be opened and it will give you a image of the mood board with soothing sounds in it.
